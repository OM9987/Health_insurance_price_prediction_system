# Health_insurance_price_prediction_system
"The GitHub repository is focused on the topic of predicting health insurance prices using machine learning. The repository contains a Streamlit app that can be used to predict the cost of health insurance based on various factors such as age, BMI, and smoking status. The algorithm used for making the prediction is linear regression.

The repository includes a Jupyter notebook that describes how the machine learning model was trained and deployed. The notebook also includes data exploration and analysis, which can provide useful insights into the data and its relationship with the target variable (i.e., insurance cost).

Overall, the goal of this repository is to make health insurance more accessible and affordable by using machine learning to predict insurance costs. Users can contribute to this effort by exploring the data, improving the machine learning model, and contributing to the Streamlit app."
